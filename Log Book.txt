The first bridge was created in Fusion 360, it contained a starting and end point. 
The top of the bridge would be a curved line. The bottom layer of the 3 layerd 
bridge was a rectangle that reached from side to side of the thinnest point of the 
curved line. The second layer consitsed of another rectangle, but with triangles 
that would strech the majority of the way along the curved line. The third and final 
layer was the curved line placed above the triangled layer. (See 3-Layer Bridge for Images)

1/16/2021:
Continued with the three layed bridge idea, created new models.

1/18/2021:
Started work on creating the alorithm, created a diagram for it.

1/20/2021:
Finished creating the algorithm, converted into pdf (Algorithm.pdf)

1/21/2021:
Brain stormed new ideas on how to advance the Sequental Bridging Technique.
Decided a square hole would be the next best thing.

1/23/2021:
Created new models in Fusion 360 (Bridging Test V1) by trying to place smaller 
rectangles, it was then decided that placing smaller rectangles broke the 
algorithm.

1/24/2021:
Attempted to apply the algoritm to a hexagonal hole, then proceded to eddit algarithm to 
acomadate hexagonal holes. Decided it hurt the overall algarithm, and decided to create
a new algarithm for hexagonal holes.

A new model was created in Fusion 360 (Bridge Test V2) by creating four rectangles on
one layer. After the model was created, it was exported in STL format and sliced in New
Creality Engine. The G-Code was then ported into repetier where diganal lines were changed
to stright lines, that would print better. The print failed in the middles but showed that 
a double layer build would help.

1/26/2021:
The previus model Bridge Test V2 was eddited to contain two layers (Bridge Test V3). After 
being ported into Cura and sliced, it was ported over to repetier where the dignal lines
were eddited stright. The first test of that design was printed but failed due to calculations
of the E interger being incorect. However, this print showed promising results. (Failed Version 3)

1/27/2021:
Changed E-Integers to allow for a successful print.
