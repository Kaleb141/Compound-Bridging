Research Plan/Project Summary

Synopsis: When 3D printing most programs will bridge a gap with supports, and then print diagonally. 
While this can be nice, it uses an unnecessary filament and can be a massive waste of time, and recourses.
However, if slicers can draw rectangles that take up the most space, and continue to do so, you could draw a 
straight line from beginning point to ending point without having to use supports and excess filament. 

Research Questions: Is there a way to bridge a gap without having to use supports?

Thesis: I can bridge a gap without having to use supports in my print.

Procedures: Beginning this project, I collected data from my mentor, then began modeled a bridge in Fusion360. 
It began as a rectangle bridging the beginning and ending points, then adding a triangle to each side on a second 
layer to lay a foundation for a curved bridge, which would be the next layer.

After having successful prints I began modeling a square with a hole in the middle after not being able to get a 
successful print I began editing G-Code, I was able to turn diagonal lines into straight lines which helped the print 
significantly and allowed me to print it without supports and it not fail, this was done by adding two rectangles to allow 
maximum coverage before moving up a layer and adding two more rectangles.

Programs Used: Fusion360 - CAD Software, Repeatier - G-Code Editor

Risk and Safety: There are no inherent risks or safety concerns.

Data Analysis: I will compare the finished products of normal bridging techniques implemented in slicers, vs my custom G-Code edited products.
